DIY 8-disks NAS based on Odroid H3+ under $1k with disks

# Why is it ugly?
Cause I didn't have time / skills to create case for it.
And yes it looks ugly as of now.

# Does it work?
Hell yeah!

# Does it support ECC?
No. It can't.

# Can it be any cheaper?
Yup.

Without disks it's below $500 ;)

Also it should still work pretty decent if you switch:
  * H3+ -> H3 - 36$ less
  * eMMC 64GB -> 32GB - $13 less
  * RAM 32GB -> 16GB - $54 less

So without disks it can be built for about $370.

# Software
It runs TrueNAS Scale
